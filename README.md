# HoriseonHomework
This is our first homework assignment
The goal was to make this website more accessible and to clean up the code without changing how the website functions. 
This was our first attempt at refracturing code. I added a few buttons and made comments to the css and html files.
I condensed the code and organized it in a way that is logical and follows accessibility standards.
